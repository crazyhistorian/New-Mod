WWONE_DESC;The World is on the brink of war. Europe is set in two alliaces, the Central Powers of Austria-Hungary and Germany, and the Triple Entente of Great Britain, France, and Russia. In the Americas, Mexico is in turmoil. The USA is a power on the rise, with a strong leader in Woodrow Wilson, and a booming economy. In Asia, Japan is another rising power, seeking to impose its rule and increase its colonial holdings across Asia. Russia is the bear of Europe, but has recently been subject to a rebellion brought on by a disasterous war with Japan. They are still a threat to be reckoned with though, as their army is one of the largest, which makes up for its technological and tactical backwardness. Germany is the finest war machine on the planet, but is being dragged down by a fading power, Austria-Hungary. The Balkans, an area full of racial unrest and tension, have almost driven Europe to war in recent years, and may well be the spark that ignites the fire looming on the dawn.;Besoins satisfaits à moins de;Erfüllte Bedürfnisse weniger als;;Necesidades satisfechas a menos de;;;;;;;;x;

Balkanoverview_Event;Overview of Balkans;États-Unis;USA;;EE UU;;;;;;;;;x
Balkanoverview_DESC;The Balkans have been a hot spot for centuries. Nationalism is on the rise. People want independence. At the 1878 Congress of Berlin, leaders of countries across Europe met to decide the fate of the Balkans. As a result of this congress, Bulgaria was established as a sattelite of the Ottomans, but lost some of its previous territory. Romania was given full independence. Serbia and Montenegro were also, but their territory was reduced. Austria took over Bosnia and Herzegovina. So, many pieces of land had claims by multuple countries. Also, the Ottoman Empire got land that was formerly owned by Bulgaria, so they wanted their land back. In the first balkan war, the Balkan countries took almost all of the rest of Turkey's land in Europe. Bulgaria was upset over division of spoils though, which led to the Second Balkan War. In this war Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece, and Romania attacked Bulgaria. Bulgaria was defeated. All countries were still upset at the end of this war, so another war could draw the intervention of the Great Powers.;x;x;;x;;;;;;;;;x

Europeoverview_Event;Overview of Europe;États-Unis;USA;;EE UU;;;;;;;;;x
Europeoverview_DESC;Europe is split into two alliances, the Central Powers and the Triple Entente. The Central Powers center around the German Empire. Germany and Austria-Hungary formed the Dual Alliance in 1879, to combat the threat of a French or Russian attack. Italy was added to the alliance in 1882. It was intended to be a defensive alliance only. These three countries form the Central Powers. But, Italy has claims on some of Austria-Hungary's land, so if war happens, their allegance will not be certain. Russia and France formed an alliance in 1887, to counterbalance the Central Powers. When Britain signed on in 1907, it was the end of their neutrality in Europe. This was partially because of Germany's growing naval power, which could threaten British naval supremacy. Those countries make up the Triple Entente;États-Unis;USA;;EE UU;;;;;;;;;x

Zimmermannrecieved_DESC;FROM 2nd from London # 5747. "We intend to begin unrestricted submarine warfare. We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral. In the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico a proposal of alliance on the following basis: make war together, make peace together, generous financial support and an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The settlement in detail is left to you. You will inform the President of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain and add the suggestion that he should, on his own initiative, invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves. Please call the President's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to make peace."
